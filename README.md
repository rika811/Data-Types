# Structure-Union
What is Structure?
Structure is a user-defined data type in C programming language that combines logically related data items of different data types together.

All the structure elements are stored at contiguous memory locations. Structure type variable can store more than one data item of varying data types under one name.

What is Union
Union is a user-defined data type, just like a structure. Union combines objects of different types and sizes together. The union variable allocates the memory space equal to the space to hold the largest variable of union. It allows varying types of objects to share the same location.
